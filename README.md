# Anime Merch Store

This repository contains the full-stack e-commerce project built as a portfolio for a senior software engineer role. The frontend uses React, Vue.js components, Tailwind CSS, and a context-based light/dark theme system. The backend is a Node.js/Express server with optional PostgreSQL integration. Features include user registration/login, product catalog with category filters, a carousel for featured products, admin product creation, and a checkout flow.

The source code is packaged in the `anime-portfolio-new.zip` file in the repository root. To explore the code locally:

1. Download the zip file from this repository.
2. Extract it to your machine.
3. Navigate into the extracted folder and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. See the `server` directory inside the extracted folder for backend API instructions, including connecting to a local PostgreSQL database.

Deployment instructions and database setup scripts are included in the `database` and `server` folders within the zip.

Enjoy building and customizing your own anime merchandise store!
